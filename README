Basic CoAP library for arduino.
Communication based on XbeeRadio https://github.com/mksense/mac/tree/master/xbee/arduino

***************************
* Master branch is working

* In this branch many things have changed:
   - resource class revamped
   - resources are now internal to coap object using vector type
   - but they can be added / updated / deleted externally
   - buffers are also internal, causing changes to many functions
   - callback function prototypes and usage
   - uri queries are now closer to the standar and allow multiple queries per request
   - apps are now easier to use coap library, with less code needed

* Not tested, may be completely broken at the moment

* Current TODO list:
   - Make retransmit and observe arrays of vector type
   - Reduce code size
   - Implement random factor for retransmit interval
